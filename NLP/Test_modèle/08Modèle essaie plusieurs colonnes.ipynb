\"Anguish deprived her of presence of mind; she gave up to me and Clara the physician's and nurse's parts; she sat by the bed, holding one little burning hand, and, with glazed eyes fixed on her babe, passed the long day in one unvaried agony.\\n\", 'Instead, he pondered deeply, and made many plans for the following day.\\n', \"Neither yours nor any man's death is needed to consummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done, but it requires my own.\\n\", 'I broke from the house angry and disturbed and retired to meditate on some other mode of action.\\n', 'Sleep fled from my eyes; I wandered like an evil spirit, for I had committed deeds of mischief beyond description horrible, and more, much more I persuaded myself was yet behind.\\n', 'It was when the streets were full of people, when she went out....\\n', 'They were, he said, of very grotesque and almost repulsive design, and had never to his knowledge been publicly worn; though my grandmother used to enjoy looking at them.\\n', 'We were in time, however, to obtain the front seats which had been reserved for us, and into which, with some little difficulty, we elbowed our way.\\n', 'This was done with the obvious design of affording a handle by which to carry the body.\\n', 'The lady whom I was much astonished to hear addressed as Madame Joyeuse, after the description of Madame Joyeuse she had just given blushed up to the eyebrows, and seemed exceedingly abashed at the reproof.\\n', 'While I still hung over her in the agony of despair, I happened to look up.\\n', 'Despite what I had heard of this hotel in Newburyport, I signed the register, paid my dollar, let the clerk take my valise, and followed that sour, solitary attendant up three creaking flights of stairs past dusty corridors which seemed wholly devoid of life.\\n', 'Of this party I was one, and did all I could to prevent the rash and fatal sally of the officer who fell, in the crowded alleys, by the poisoned arrow of a Bengalee.\\n', 'The months following my discovery were spent in futile attempts to force the complicated padlock of the slightly open vault, and in carefully guarded inquiries regarding the nature and history of the structure.\\n', 'How long it might require to evoke and extinguish the thing, we had no notion.\\n', 'She never mentioned her father to Perdita, she appeared half afraid when she spoke of him to me, and though I tried to draw her out on the subject, and to dispel the gloom that hung about her ideas concerning him, I could not succeed.\\n', \"At length Athib told him that their journey was near its end, and that they would soon enter the harbour of Serannian, the pink marble city of the clouds, which is built on that ethereal coast where the west wind flows into the sky; but as the highest of the city's carven towers came into sight there was a sound somewhere in space, and Kuranes awaked in his London garret.\\n\", 'It was not till one of them died that he perceived their danger; one by one they were carried off by pestilence; and his wife, his helpmate and supporter, more necessary to him than his own limbs and frame, which had hardly been taught the lesson of self preservation, the kind companion whose voice always spoke peace to him, closed her eyes in death.\\n', 'He could not really care for me, I thought, for if he did the storm would rather have made him come even if I had not expected him, than, as it did, prevent a promised visit.\\n', '\"It was Asaph\\'s coffin, Birch, just as I thought I knew his teeth, with the front ones missing on the upper jaw never, for God\\'s sake, shew those wounds The body was pretty badly gone, but if ever I saw vindictiveness on any face or former face. . . .\\n', \"This aroused the stranger's attention, and he asked a multitude of questions concerning the route which the demon, as he called him, had pursued.\\n\", 'I had scarcely laid the first tier of my masonry when I discovered that the intoxication of Fortunato had in a great measure worn off.\\n', 'My own name, though, as I say, became Simpson, by act of Legislature, and with so much repugnance on my part, that, at one period, I actually hesitated about accepting the legacy with the useless and annoying proviso attached.\\n', 'He would forsake her, England, his friends, the scenes of his youth, the hopes of coming time, he would seek another country, and in other scenes begin life again.\\n', 'I was for ever with him.\\n', 'The golden and silver fish haunted the river, out of the bosom of which issued, little by little, a murmur that swelled, at length, into a lulling melody more divine than that of the harp of Aeolus sweeter than all save the voice of Eleonora.\\n', 'This good woman had stood in the place of a mother, and her very deficiencies of education and knowledge, by rendering her humble and defenceless, endeared her to us she was the especial favourite of the children.\\n', 'Birch, in his ghastly situation, was now too low for an easy scramble out of the enlarged transom; but gathered his energies for a determined try.\\n', 'I looked in the drawer, and found none there.\\n', 'At once, I seemed to awake; I cast off the clinging sloth of the past months; earth assumed a new appearance, and my view of the future was suddenly made clear.\\n', 'No arm is without hair.\\n', '\"I\\'ll tell you, I\\'m good and

ill health and vexation.\\n', 'It must have been merely the association of any odd circumstance with the sinister nature of our location and mission, for surely the circumstance was not in itself frightful or unnatural.\\n', 'Dangers he met unflinchingly; crimes he committed unmoved.\\n', 'As this state of wretchedness became more confirmed, and, in spite of her endeavours at concealment more apparent, I strove, though vainly, to awaken in her courage and hope.\\n', 'Were the pride of ancestry, the patrician spirit, the gentle courtesies and refined pursuits, splendid attributes of rank,
